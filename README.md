# Doko nani tabeyouka
This is the Japanese version of [Where do you want to eat?](https://github.com/karina-42/whereDoYouWantToEat), but it is incomplete and not hosted anywhere.

I started working on this project in Japanese, then I had friends express an interest in using an English version, so I focused my attention on completing an English version first. Now, instead of making a separate Japanese version, I'm focused on adding Japanese language to the English site so users can switch between languages on one site instead of having to visit another. 
I think this will be useful when I add the ability to add friends and share restaurants, language will not be a barrier.
